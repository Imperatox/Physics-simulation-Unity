The task:
Make a simple court with, for example, a ramp, a ball, and bowling pins. Use Rigidbody components so that at least one game piece starts moving and hits other game pieces that, for example, fall or move. You can also make other fields, for example falling dominoes, as long as the change is done with the help of the physics engine. Make sure the pieces fall clearly. If necessary, you can change the mass of the Rigidbody pieces, or make the cones or blocks to be knocked down narrower and taller. Return two screenshots: "before" and "after". 

I didn't use too much time for this because the main thing was to learn the use of Rigidbody components.
